             Have you ever seen those white dots in the night sky? <br> <br>
                 Have you ever wondered what those are and why are they there? <br> <br>
                 Have you ever thought about what’s beside those white dots? <br> <br>
                  Let me ask a few questions. Which place are you currently in? You might say the name of your place. Where is the place? You might say the country you are living in. <br> Where is your country? You might say Earth. Where is Earth? You might say in the universe. And where is the universe? …… You don’t have an answer.
                   <br><br> Every day, most of the scientists are searching for this answer. If we see from our naked eyes, we might see thousands of stars. If we use a telescope to see that besides those stars, we see millions of stars. If we even use Very Large Telescopes to see what’s behind those million stars, we are seeing another trillion stars. Experts say that there are a greater number of stars than the grain of sand on the earth.
                  <br><br> Then there is no boundary of the universe? The universe is endless??
                  <br><br> And the answer is we still don’t know.
                  <br><br> The main problem is the speed of light. Now it’s proved that the speed of light is constant. So, an object should emit or reflect light and those lights should reach to our eyes to be visible to us. The star Sirius (brightest star) is around 8.5 light years away. It means that light from Sirius takes around 8.5 years to visit Earth. Thus, don’t you think when we see the star Sirius, we see 8.5 years before. Isn’t it interesting? So how does it relate to the boundary of the universe?
                  <br><br> You might have heard that the universe is expanding. Everything near us is moving apart. And the rate of expansion is directly proportional to distance from us. It is also known as Hubble’s law. It means that the stars nearer to us expands slower and the stars far from us expands at a higher rate. In this process of expansion, there comes a time where the stars are moving apart at the speed of light and more. So, let’s just imagine, at that point, if those bright stars are moving very fast around the speed of light or more, could the light from those stars reach us? Yes, the answer is no. Thus, as the speed of light is constant, we are not able to see objects too far from us. This is a boundary which is stopping us to explore the end of the universe.
                    <br><br>But who knows, in the future we might find a particle which travels infinitely faster and we could be able to observe the end of the universe. So, let’s keep our eyes in the sky and explore the universe. Who knows, you could find things no one has noticed yet.
